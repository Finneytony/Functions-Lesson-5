🧠 C++ Lesson 5 – Understanding Functions (with Real-World Examples)

Welcome to Lesson 5 of my C++ Beginner Series!
In this project, we explore functions — one of the most important building blocks in programming. You’ll learn how to organize your code, make it reusable, and think like a true developer.

📘 What You’ll Learn

How to create and call functions in C++

Using parameters and return values

Writing modular, readable, and reusable code

Applying logical operators (&&, ||) inside functions

A real-world example: login validation and grade calculator

💡 Code Highlights

This lesson demonstrates how to:

Separate logic into functions like loginCheck() and calculateAverage()

Use user input effectively with getline() and conditionals

Return meaningful results from your functions

Build small programs that feel like real applications

🧩 File Structure

🚀 Next Steps

If you’re following the full series, this lesson connects everything you’ve learned so far — from variables and conditionals to loops and logic — preparing you for arrays, pointers, and object-oriented programming in the next lessons.
